test making dmr_analysis package
Here bedtools2.30 may have problem in intersect for long lines between two files, it will cut the long line in some predefined length 
that may cause information loss in exported file . Currently, we can use bedtools2.27 but in future dmr_analaysis shall take care of this long line issues in the export file!!
